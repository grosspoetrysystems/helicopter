# Maintainer operating modes

Helicopter separates trusted project work from external contribution intake. Choose one repository mode:

| Mode | Use when | Metadata exemption | Protected-branch reviews |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `solo` | One human owns or maintains the project | The configured immutable user ID, on a same-repository branch | Zero required approvals |
| `contributor` | One or more maintainers primarily receive external contributions | None; every pull request follows the contribution contract | One approval and CODEOWNER review |
| `team` | An internal organization team builds in the open and also accepts external contributions | Same-repository authors GitHub identifies as `OWNER`, `MEMBER`, or `COLLABORATOR` | One approval, CODEOWNER review, and approval after the latest push |

Unset or invalid mode configuration fails closed to `contributor`.

## Configure or change mode

Authenticate an administrator, ensure the default branch exists, and run:

```sh
gh auth status
python3 scripts/configure_repository.py MODE --repo OWNER/REPOSITORY
```

Replace `MODE` with `solo`, `contributor`, or `team`. The configurator:

1. protects the default branch;
2. requires up-to-date `test-validator` and `validate-metadata` checks;
3. blocks force pushes and branch deletion;
4. requires resolved conversations;
5. applies the review policy for the selected mode;
6. sets the repository-scoped `HELICOPTER_MODE` variable;
7. sets `HELICOPTER_SOLO_MAINTAINER_ID` to the authenticated user's immutable ID only in `solo` mode, and deletes it in other modes.

Run the configurator again to change modes. Do not set Helicopter mode variables at organization scope: GitHub merges organization variables into the same `vars` context, which could affect every inheriting repository.

Required checks must have run successfully before making them required. During first installation, open valid and invalid draft pull requests before running the configurator.

## Trust decisions

### Solo

The exemption applies only when:

1. `HELICOPTER_SOLO_MAINTAINER_ID` is a positive decimal GitHub user ID;
2. the pull-request author and event sender are that user;
3. the author, sender, and repository owner are human users for a personal repository, or the repository belongs to an organization;
4. the event repository and pull-request base and head repositories have the same immutable repository ID.

Other users, bots, and forks follow the external contribution contract.

### Contributor

Nobody bypasses contribution metadata. This is the conservative mode for a maintainer-led open source project. External contributors cannot merge their own work; protected paths require CODEOWNER review.

Repository administrators retain emergency bypass because branch protection is not enforced for administrators. Use that authority deliberately.

### Team

GitHub's server-supplied `author_association` identifies trusted repository relationships. Helicopter accepts the internal path only when:

1. the author association is `OWNER`, `MEMBER`, or `COLLABORATOR`;
2. the author and event sender are the same human user;
3. the pull request uses a branch in the governed repository, not a fork.

The same-repository requirement matters: organization membership alone does not grant the exemption. An internal coworker using a fork follows the external path. A collaborator trusted with repository write access is treated as internal even if they are not an employee.

External contributors, bots, and fork pull requests always follow the full contribution contract.

## Shared protection policy

All modes:

- require the exact `test-validator` and `validate-metadata` check contexts;
- require branches to be up to date;
- require resolved review conversations;
- block force pushes and branch deletion;
- leave administrator enforcement disabled for emergency recovery;
- keep production deploy and release triggers explicit.

`solo` deliberately requires no approval because no second reviewer exists. `contributor` requires one approval but does not require approval after the latest push, allowing a maintainer to complete review after contributor updates. `team` requires approval after the latest push so one coworker cannot both supply the final update and final approval.

Inspect the effective classic branch protection:

```sh
gh api repos/OWNER/REPOSITORY/branches/BRANCH/protection \
  --jq '{
    strict: .required_status_checks.strict,
    checks: .required_status_checks.contexts,
    admin_enforced: .enforce_admins.enabled,
    approvals: .required_pull_request_reviews.required_approving_review_count,
    codeowners: .required_pull_request_reviews.require_code_owner_reviews,
    last_push: .required_pull_request_reviews.require_last_push_approval,
    conversations: .required_conversation_resolution.enabled,
    force_pushes: .allow_force_pushes.enabled,
    deletions: .allow_deletions.enabled
  }'
```

Repository rulesets and organization rulesets may add stricter controls:

```sh
gh api repos/OWNER/REPOSITORY/rulesets
gh api repos/OWNER/REPOSITORY/rules/branches/BRANCH
```

## Trusted intake

The metadata workflow uses `pull_request_target` and loads its validator from `github.event.repository.default_branch`. It never checks out or executes pull-request code. The mode variable is read at run time, but workflow changes must reach the protected default branch before the new behavior exists.

The exemption returns success before parsing the pull-request body. It does not auto-check attestations or invent provenance. Project builds and tests remain in an unprivileged `pull_request` workflow.

## Direct pushes and releases

A direct administrator push is appropriate only when an administrator has reviewed a small change locally and accepts that required checks run after it reaches the default branch. This is emergency or solo-maintainer authority, not proof that checks ran before landing.

Do not attach production publication to every default-branch push merely because administrators can bypass protection:

```text
push or merge to main  -> CI only
explicit site deploy   -> production site/landing publication
version tag or release -> CLI/package publication
```

## Stacked pull requests

GitHub can identify dependent pull requests as a stack. The normal GraphQL merge mutation may require the asynchronous REST merge endpoint:

```text
PUT /repos/OWNER/REPOSITORY/pulls/NUMBER/merge-async
GET /repos/OWNER/REPOSITORY/pulls/NUMBER/merge-async/UUID
```

A `202` only enqueues the merge. Poll until the result is `merged` or `failed`. The async endpoint has no administrator-override parameter, so required checks still apply.
